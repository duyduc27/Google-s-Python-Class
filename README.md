# Google-s-Python-Class
This is a [free class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python<br>

These files already had "solution" folders. I tried to finish these exercises without peaking the solutions given. I skipped logpuzzle exercise also. Although the original py files were for Python2 but I finished these exercise in Python3.
